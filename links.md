# Links

You can find me in a number of places online:

- My work can largely be found on [my github](https://github.com/kkuchta).
- I'm currently between social networks and trying out a few, so some of these may go dead over time:
  - [@kkuchta@ruby.social on Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@kkuchta)
  - [@kkuchta on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kkuchta)
  - [@kevinkuchta.com on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/kevinkuchta.com)
- I occasionally draw comics, which can be found at [Fishtoaster.com](https://fishtoaster.com/).  It's mostly dumb puns like [this](https://fishtoaster.com/images/radical_condor.jpg).
- I have a poorly-maintained [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinkuchta/)
