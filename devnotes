Ok, starting this out on 2023-02-28.

- Looks like I want no theme. Just set up \_layouts and \_includes. I've disabled the minima theme.

TODO:

- Clean up the \_config.yml
  - See if the feed plugin is necessary.
- X Mobile friendly
  - Probably want to set up a little header with my name and a popover hamburger menu (mobile only)
    - Good examples:
      - https://www.stavros.io/
      - https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/
      - https://www.duckbillgroup.com/
      - https://minimaxir.com/
    - Or I could do a static menu like this:
      - https://wizardzines.com/faq/
- Set up a proper 404 page and route whatever hosting I use to it.
- Set up the archive stylings.
- Do the other main pages
  - X projects
  - x Hacks
  - Resume
  - Contact
- X Syntax highlighting
- Maybe go through and try to fix some old links.
- Set up a script to print out the resume to pdf.
- Update everything to 'kevin highwater'
- Create something to deploy to kevinkuchta to do 301 (permenant) redirects to kevinhighwater.com
